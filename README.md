<h1>angry-birds</h1>

This contains the project for course CSE-201 (Advanced Programming). In this we have made the angry-birds game.

<h2>How to run?</h2>
1) clone the repository<br>
2) set the root as idea project<br>
3) set gradle configuration as:
<br>
Run:run<br>
Gradle Project: myProject:lwjgl3 

<br>
4)<i>Click on Run</i>

<h2>Methods defined in the game</h2>
1) In each level we have added loadGameState and saveGameState methods for serialization, we are storing the game state (all the blocks, piggies and birds) by pressing <i> s</i> and then you can load it using <i>l</i>. Even if the game exits, you can restart the game and press <i>l</i> to load perfectly.
2) We have added game classes in the package Game_Classes: Piggy, Bird, Ground, Wall which have we initialized in arrays and disposed when destroyed.
